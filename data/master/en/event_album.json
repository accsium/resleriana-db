However, due to the appearance of monsters on the shore, tourists are staying away, and the fireworks festival is in danger of being canceled. We've decided to work together and use alchemy to build a beach house to bring the tourists back!\nFirst, we held a swimsuit fashion show. Ryza wore a cute swimsuit that suited her perfectly, while Valeria and Klaudia both wore more stylish swimsuits that matched their unique styles. I also showed off the swimsuit Izana picked out for me.\nWe decided to start by making a large beach umbrella! Now let's work at making the Beach House bigger and better! (Resna)",
